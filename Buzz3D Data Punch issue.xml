Hi All, Please note, the Buzz 2.5D job number and Decipher "directory" Job number have to match or data will not import back into Decipher.
This has come up a few times lately and want to be sure everyone understands this. Behaviorally should prepare the files correctly in the first place, but sometimes there is internal miscommunication, and I look to the programmers to point it out and know that if they don't match, it won't work and to report it immediately. It's not just about the image names; it's about the link to the Buzz platform - the job numbers have to match.  
It's not something you can fix by just changing the image name or the redirect in Decipher - BEH has to either re-set up the Buzz 2.5D or you would have to change the job directory in Decipher. 
Please forward this to all the programmers. If this happens, consult with the BEH project person or me. 
Thank you,
Michele
