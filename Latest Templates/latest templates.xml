Hi - Cody brought to my attention that there is some missing data for Buzz on ah508 - Sahil is checking in the morning, but he also mentioned the template used was outdated. Can you please make sure the programmers are aware to use the most recent Shopper Flash

It does not have the buzz shopping - i can add it in, but the most up to date Buzz shopping is in the PackFlash Template  https://emea.focusvision.com/apps/portal#/projects/detail/selfserve/1da7/191272?q=l3333
